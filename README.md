# HyperLoopTrips
This project is a demonstration of my skills as a web developer, showcasing a fully functional web application for booking HyperLoop trips. The application allows users to reserve trips, select different ticket types, and choose from various destinations. It highlights my abilities in HTML, CSS, and responsive web design.
